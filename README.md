
Save gas, save your wallet, and save the world! EPA studies have shown you can save the equivalent of $1.50 per gallon by using your gas and breaks more gently, especially when turning. This Android app helps you pull it off!

When you are driving the right way to save the most, you'll see a large good indicator on the screen:

If you are doing something like accelerating too fast, the app will warn you with a large picture indicator as well:

Later on you can check your stats and share them on Google+. You can see the savings leveled off when the acceleration went wild in this graph:

If you do a perfect job, you can share an image of the graph on Google+, and brag your awesome driving saved you money for coffee to all your friends!

By default, the app expects the screen to point at the back of the car and halfway up toward the sky, 45 degrees. You can calibrate it in the options, however. Check out the settings to customize the app exactly to what you need. You can set what amounts of acceleration trigger conditions, and adjust the cents per hour you save to match your life exactly.
